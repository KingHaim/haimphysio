Living in Marbella means embracing an active lifestyle—whether it's running along the Paseo Marítimo, playing padel, or hiking in the Sierra Blanca. But knee pain, especially around the kneecap (patellofemoral pain syndrome), can slow you down. The good news? New research shows we can predict this type of knee pain early using just a few simple clinical tests, helping you stay proactive about your joint health.

At our physiotherapy clinic in Marbella, we focus on practical, evidence-based approaches. Based on recent studies, here are actionable tips to help you identify and address patellofemoral pain early:

1. **Listen to Your Body**: Pay attention to pain around or behind your kneecap during activities like squatting, climbing stairs, or after prolonged sitting. Early signs often include a dull ache that worsens with movement.
2. **Try Simple Self-Tests**: Perform a single-leg squat in front of a mirror. Watch for your knee drifting inward—this can indicate muscle imbalances that contribute to patellofemoral pain. Do this gently and stop if you feel discomfort.
3. **Strengthen Key Muscles**: Focus on exercises for your hips and quadriceps. In Marbella's warm climate, try low-impact options like swimming or cycling along the coast to build strength without stressing your knees.
4. **Seek Professional Assessment**: If you notice persistent symptoms, visit a physiotherapist. We use minimal, interpretable tests—like assessing your movement patterns and muscle strength—to predict risks and create personalized prevention plans.

By combining local active living with smart, early detection, you can keep your knees healthy and enjoy all that Marbella has to offer. Remember, prevention is key—don't wait for pain to limit your adventures!
